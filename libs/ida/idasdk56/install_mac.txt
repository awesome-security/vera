How to install SDK under Mac OS X
------------------------------

The installation for Mac OS X is the same as for Linux.
Please refer to the install_linux.txt file for details.

The only difference is that you have to define the environment
variable __MAC__.

In order to compile the iPhone debugger server, you'll have to specify
the __IPHONE__ variable:

alias im='__IPHONE__=1 idamake.pl 2>&1'

Please note that the iPhone debugger server can handle only iPhone v1.x
