How to install SDK under Linux
------------------------------

All source files are the same for all platforms and are compiled using the
same makefile. However, since IDA makefiles use Borland format,
we have to preprocess them before passing them to UNIX make.
It is done using the idamake.pl script in the bin subdirectory:

        ~/idasrc/bin/idamake.pl

This script will preprocess the makefile, create a temporary makefile
and launch the gnu make utility on it.

To create idal64 modules, define the __EA64__ symbol for make. For example:

        __EA64__=1 ~/idasrc/bin/idamake.pl

will compile a modlue for the 64-bit version of IDA.

Please note that idal64 itself is a 32-bit application, so the above line
compiles a 32-bit module that can handle 64-bit applications with idal64.

To create a true 64-bit debugger module, define the __X64__ symbol:

        __X64__=1 ~/idasrc/bin/idamake.pl

This mode of compilation should be used only for debugger servers (all
other IDA modules are 32-bit).

Creating an alias for this commands is a good idea. I have the following in my
.bashrc file:

alias m='idamake.pl 2>&1'
alias mm='__EA64__=1 idamake.pl 2>&1'
alias mx='__X64__=1 idamake.pl 2>&1'

-----------------------------------------------

        Installation:

0. Unzip the archive to the directory of your choice ($HOME/idasrc is ok)

1. Edit the allmake.unx file to modify path to the sdk (the IDA variable)

2. Add the $(IDA)/bin directory to your PATH

3. Copy libida*.so files from your ida distribution to the idasdk/bin directory.
